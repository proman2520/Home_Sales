# Home_Sales

In this repository, there are two jupyter notebooks. The starter was just used to compare the outputs when necessary, while the code is in Home_Sales.ipynb. For it to properly run, it must be opened and executed in Google Colab. The partioned parquet files are not included in this repository (since the rubric did not request them), but they can be provided if needed.

I enjoyed this assignment and the class overall. I appreciate your time and consideration grading my assignment.

Best,
Andrew
